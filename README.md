# System Analysis and Reporting for Advanced Hardware (SARAH)

In mid-August, System Analysis and Reporting for Advanced Hardware (SARAH) will be tested on a photovoltaic emulator in Low Earth Orbit. The purpose of this experiment is to test SARAH's effectiveness in detecting, classifying, and localizing faults in spacecraft electrical power systems during an actual mission in Earth's orbit. We will analyze how changes in radiation intensity and temperature variance impacts SARAH's accuracy. 

This repository is being updated throughout the duration of this project. The final repository will be completed by July.
